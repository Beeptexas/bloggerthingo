its like 1:26 AM and i got bored so i got github. I've tried diary type systems before but i cant keep track of them, if this blows up i might take things more seriously.
But for now all i am is a person with a computer, im wearing 1 year old jeans because my house's AC is broken and all i have are sweatpants, jeans normally make me uncomfortable
but honeslty they can be comfy if they're made right. I honestly dont know what to talk about, but hey, maybe tomorrow I'll have more content to write, if i even write tomorrow
